description: A utility function for conditionally joining CSS class names together.

The `cn` function is a helper utility that simplifies the process of conditionally applying CSS class names. It combines the power of `clsx` for conditional class joining and `tailwind-merge` for intelligently merging Tailwind CSS classes without style conflicts.

## Usage

```typescript
import { cn } from '@tszhong0411/utils'

const className = cn('text-blue-500', 'font-bold', false && 'hidden', 'mt-4')
// className will be "text-blue-500 font-bold mt-4"
```

## API

### `cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string`

Joins CSS class names together.

- `...inputs`: A variable number of arguments, which can be strings, arrays of strings, or objects where keys are class names and values are booleans.

**Returns:** `string` - A string of joined and merged CSS class names.
