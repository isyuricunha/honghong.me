## Recipes

I've collected some recipes that I've used in my projects. E.g. how to setup Drizzle and t3-env.

## UI

This is a collection of components that are built using the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library.
The main difference between this and the original library is the code style.
I've changed to use arrow functions, and not to destructure the `props` in the function parameters. Write separate props type for each component. Long Tailwind CSS classes are divided into multiple lines for better readability.

Also, I've used [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/) for the components that are not yet available in the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)/[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) library. E.g. SegmentGroup and TreeView.

Pagination is also rewritten using the [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/) library for better accessibility.
